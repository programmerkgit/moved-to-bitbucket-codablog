<h1>Node Types and Roles</h1>
<p>A BitCoin node may take take on different roles depending on the functionality</p>
<p>A BitCoin node is a collection of functions: routing, database, mining, and wallet</p>
<p>Full node with all four of these functionality is shown in Figure 8-1</p>

<h2>Routing</h2>
<p>To Participate in bitcoin network, node needs routing functionality. So every node in the network has routing
  functionality</p>
<p>Routing functionality validate and propagate transactions and blocks</p>
<p>Routing functionality discover and maintain connections to the network</p>

<h2>Full Node</h2>
<p>Full Node has full functionality, and has a copy of Full BlockChain. They can verify transaction authoritatively
  without
  reference to the other nodes.
</p>
<h2>SPV Node</h2>
<p>Some Nodes maintain only subset of BlockChain, and verify transaction using a method called<span>simplified payment verification</span>
  or SPV. These nodes are known ad SPV or lightweight nodes.
</p>

<h2>Mining Nodes</h2>
<p>Mining nodes compete to create new blocks by running speciallized hadware to solve the Proof Of Work algorithm.
  Some Mining Nodes mqy be full node, and others are lightweight nodes participating
  in (pool mining) and depending on mining pool server which maintains a full node
